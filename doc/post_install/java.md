# Java

- Open up a terminal and type in these commands:
```bash
sudo dnf upgrade
sudo dnf install java-latest-openjdk
```
- This will install and setup the Java JDK for you.
- Remember! JDK versions will be named in the same format. So JDK 11 would be named as **java-11-openjdk** and so on. So if you want to install other versions of the JDK you follow the same format. Its easy, isn't it? :D

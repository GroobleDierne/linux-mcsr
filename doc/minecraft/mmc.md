# MultiMC

- Download the .deb file for MultiMC from [here](https://multimc.org).
- It will be under the Linux downloads and the download link for **Debian/Ubuntu** is what we are looking for.
- After downloading it, locate to the file on the file manager and double click on the file and it will install MultiMC on your system for you.
- Now open MultiMC and login and create instances as per usual.
- Make sure to select the right Java version that you installed in the previous step from the list of auto detected Java installations. Linux Mint comes with a pre-installed Java version which is pretty outdated for Minecraft.

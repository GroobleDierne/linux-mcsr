# Installation
The instructions given below will install Linux Mint on your PC. Make sure to follow through the instructions here carefully.

# From Zero to Hero
- After testing out Linux Mint on the live environment, you are now ready to install it on your PC.
- You can connect to your home network in order to install some updates during the installation. But this is optional, you can proceed to install Linux Mint even without connecting to the internet.
- There are two options for you at this point. You can either 
  - Have an empty hard drive to install Mint on it.
  - Or have it be installed on your hard drive with Windows on it. (It will be installed alongside Windows so you need not worry. Just make sure you have enough space on that hard drive to have Linux Mint on it. Recommended size is about 100 GB of free space or above).
- No matter what you pick above most steps remain the same.
- Now on the Live Environment, double click on the icon named **Install Linux Mint**.
- A new window would open up asking you to pick a keyboard layout.
- Select your preferred keyboard layout and click on **Continue**.
- On the next menu you will be prompted to install multimedia codecs. We recommend that you install these by checking the box and hitting **Continue**.

## Installation Type
- The option you selected above matters only here. Be very sure that you have plugged in the right disks for installation. A gentle reminder to check and re-check them right now before continuing.
  - If you chose to install Mint on a separate empty hard drive, you will be prompted to **Erase disk and install Linux Mint** which is what we will pick. Click on the radio button to activate it and then hit **Continue**. If prompted to confirm, you can accept and carry on.
  - If you chose to install Mint alongside your Windows install, you will have the above option and along with that would be another option to install Linux Mint alongside Windows. We pick that option by clicking on the radio button and then hitting **Continue**. You will then be prompted with the amount of space the installer thinks it should allocate for Mint and Windows. You can directly click on **Continue** again and if prompted to confirm, you can accept and carry on.

# Continuation of Installation
- You will now be prompted to select your timezone. You can click on where you live and your system time will be set to that.
- Next you will be prompted to set your username, hostname (the computer's name) and your password. This password will be required to login to your system and this is the username that you will login to your install with. 
- Click on **Continue** and you are done! Wait for about 15-20 minutes (dependent on your network speed) and your Linux Mint install should be complete! Easy right? Well, we still have to setup everything for MCSR. This is still the basic installation!
- The installer will prompt you to restart your PC. You can do that and remove the bootable USB that you plugged in.
- Now you can boot into your install and move forward to install everything related to MCSR [here](https://github.com/sathya-pramodh/linux-mcsr/blob/main/doc/post-install.md).

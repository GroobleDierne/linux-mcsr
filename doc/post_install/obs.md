# OBS

- If you want to install OBS on your system, you can proceed with this section of the instructions.
- Go into **Software Manager** same as before and search for **OBS**.
- It will show you an application for OBS Studio with a **Flathub** icon under it.
- This is an official package from the OBS devs. There is another package named **obs-studio**. This is also another official package, but I haven't tested it out so it is recommended to install the **Flathub** version.
- After downloading and installing it, you can open it and set it up as per usual.
- OBS setup for **resetti** is detailed in the docs for **resetti**.

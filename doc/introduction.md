# Introduction
The instructions given below will be the pre-install setup. By the end of it, you will have a bootable USB stick with Linux Mint installed on it.

# Distributions
- Linux, being a **free and open source operating system**, comes in several different flavours a.k.a distributions a.k.a distros.
- Some of the popular distributions are **Ubuntu**, **Fedora**, **Arch Linux(btw)**, etc.
- For MCSR, we recommend a distribution based on **Ubuntu** called **Linux Mint**.
- Make sure to go [here](https://linuxmint.com/download.php) and download the latest ISO for Linux Mint.
- Out of the three different editions that Linux Mint provides, we recommend the **Cinnamon Edition** because it works really well with [resetti](https://github.com/woofdoggo/resetti), which we will be installing later on.
- You can learn more about **Linux Distributions** [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution).

# Installing Linux Mint
- After downloading the distribution ISO from the official Linux Mint website, pick up a USB stick of at least 5GB space or above. 
- **NOTE: The USB stick will be formatted during the install process and all data on it will be erased.**
- To install the ISO into the USB stick, use **Balena Etcher** from [here](https://www.balena.io/etcher#download-etcher). Click on the Windows installer link to download it.
- Run through the Balena Etcher installer as per usual.
- Plug in the USB stick to your PC and open Balena Etcher.
- Under **Select Image**, locate to wherever you downloaded the Linux Mint ISO from before and select it.
- Under **Select Drive**, select the USB device name. It should be auto-selected for you, just make sure its the right USB.
- Then click **Flash** to start creating your Bootable USB!
- Wait for it to finish **Flashing** and **Verifying** as well. Don't quit Balena until all of it is done.
- Congratulations! You just created a bootable Linux Mint USB!

# Moving Ahead
- Now we start with the difficult part of the installation. We make decisions based on your PC configuration. So make sure to follow through the instructions very carefully.

# MultiMC

- Here, we will be installing a fork of MultiMC called [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org).
- Open up a terminal and type in these commands:
```bash
sudo dnf copr enable g3tchoo/prismlauncher
sudo dnf install prismlauncher
```
- This should install Prism Launcher. Make sure to select the correct Java Version while setting up the launcher.

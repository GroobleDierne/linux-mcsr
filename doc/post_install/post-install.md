# Post Install

The instructions given below will guide you through the post installation procedure of installing Linux for MCSR.

# Software Manager

- The software manager is the best place for you to search and install packages and apps.
- If you cannot find any package on it for some reason, Googling about it is your best friend. If Google doesn't have an answer for it too, then you can open an issue in [here](https://github.com/sathya-pramodh/linux-mcsr/issues/).

# Update Cycle

- Linux Mint usually doesn't remind you or bug you to update your packages over and over.
- It has an update manager that reminds you if you have some major security updates pending.
- But if for some reason it misses it, then our recommendation is for you to follow a **monthly** update schedule, i.e., make sure to update all your packages by opening **Update Manager** on a monthly basis.
- This is just to make sure you don't run into any problems and to get the latest software for your system as early as possible.

# All done!

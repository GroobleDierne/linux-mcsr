# Linux Terminal

- To use Linux on the Desktop casually, you wouldn't need to know the terminal at all.

- You can skip this altogether though and just blindly follow the instructions, but to debug stuff better, it is better to know these basics.
- To learn about the basics of the Linux commandline proceed to [here](https://github.com/sathya-pramodh/linux-mcsr/blob/main/doc/terminal.md).
- It also has some basic scripting examples with two scripts that you can use to make your life easier with MCSR.

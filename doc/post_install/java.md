# Java

- Before proceeding with anything from this point, go into **Update Manager** from either the startup dialog or by searching for the application as you would do on Windows.
- Make sure to update all the software pre-installed on the OS.
- After doing that, go into **Software Manager** either from the startup dialog or by searching for the application.
- In there, search for **openjdk-19-jdk** and download and install the package with the same name.
- This will install and setup the Java JDK for you.
- Remember! JDK versions will be named in the same format. So JDK 11 would be named as **openjdk-11-jdk** and so on. So if you want to install other versions of the JDK you follow the same format. Its easy, isn't it? :D
